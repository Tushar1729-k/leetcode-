# Introduction
`Array` is one of the fundamental blocks in data structure. Since a `string` is just formed by an array of characters they are both similar. Most interview questions fall into this category.
In this card we will introduce array and string. After finishing this card you should:
1. Understand the differences between `array` and `dynamic array`;
2. Be familiar with `basic operations` in the array and dynamic array;
3. Understand `multidimensional arrays` and be able to use a `two-dimensional array`;
4. Understand the concept of `string` and different features string has;
5. Be able to apply the `two-pointer technique` to practical problems.
