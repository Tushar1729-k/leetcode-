# Introduction to Array
In this chapter we are going to introduce two important concepts: `array` and `dynamic array`.
These are the basic data structures you should be familiar with. We also provide a tutorial for you to use built-in array and dynamic array.
Be completing this chapter you should be able to answer the following questions:
1. What is the `difference` between array and dynamic array?
2. What is the corresponding `built-in data structure` of array and dynamic array in your frequently-used language?
3. How to perform `basic operations` (initialization, data access, modification, iteration, sort, etc) in an `array`?
4. How to perform `basic operations` (initialization, data access, modification, iteration, sort, addition, deletion, etc) in a `dynamic array`?
