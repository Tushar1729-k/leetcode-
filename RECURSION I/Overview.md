# Introduction
`Recursion` is an important concept in computer science. It is a foundation for many other algorithms and data structures. However the concept of recursion can be tricky to grasp for many beginners.
Before getting started with this card we strongly recommend that you complete the [binary tree](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/) and the [stack](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/) Explore cards first.
In this Explore card we answer the following questions:
1. What is `recursion`? How does it work?
2. How to solve a problem recursively?
3. How to analyze the `time` and `space` complexity of a recursive algorithm?
4. How can we apply `recursion` in a better way?

After completing this card you will feel more confident in your ability to solve problems recursively and to analyze the complexity on your own.
Before you start bear in mind that should you have any questions or comments you can always post them on the [Discussion](https://leetcode.com/discuss/explore/recursion-i) forum that is located at the end of this card. We'll do our best to respond to you as soon as we can.
