# Introduction
`Hash Table` is a data structure which organizes data using `hash functions` in order to support quick insertion and search.
There are two different kinds of hash tables: hash set and hash map.
- The `hash set` is one of the implementations of a `set` data structure to store `no repeated values`.
- The `hash map` is one of the implemnentations of a `map` data structure to store `(key, value)` pairs.
It is `easy to use` a hash table with the help of `standard template libraries`. Most common languages such as Java, C++ and Python support both hash set and hash map.
By choosing a proper hash function the hash table can achieve `wonderful performance` in both insertion and search.
In this card we will answer the following questions:
1. What is the `principle` of a hash table?
2. How to `design` a hash table?
3. How to use `hash set` to solve duplicates related problems?
4. How to use `hash map` to aggregate information by key?
5. How to `design a proper key` when using a hash table?
And we also provide exercises for you to be familiar with hash table.
