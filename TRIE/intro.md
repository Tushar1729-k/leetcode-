In this card we will go deep into the implementatioin of Trie and talk about how to use this data structure to solve problems

After completing this card you should be able to 
1. understand the `concept` of Trie
2. do `insertion` and `search` operations in a Trie
3. understand how Trie helps in `practical applications`
4. solve practical problems using Trie
