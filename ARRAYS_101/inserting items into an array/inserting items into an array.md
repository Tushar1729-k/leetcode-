# Inserting Items Into an Array
In the previous chapter, we looked at what Arrays are, and the basic programming constructs of Arrays in Java. We're now going to use these basic constructs to implement three key operations for Arrays:

- Inserting items.
- Removing items.
- Searching for items.
These three operations are the fundamental operations for all data structures.

In this chapter, we'll be starting with inserting items into an array. Like before, we'll approach the learning with lots of examples and programming snippets. After that, there are some more interview questions for you to practice on. We hope you have fun!
