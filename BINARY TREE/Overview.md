# Introduction
A `tree` is a frequently-used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.

Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes which are called child nodes. From a graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic graph which has `N nodes` and `N-1 edges`.

A `Binary Tree` is one of the most typical tree structures. As the name suggests a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has `at most two children` which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

By completing this card you will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of a `tree` and a `binary tree`;
2. Be familiar with different `traversal` methods;
3. Use `recursion` to solve binary-tree-related problem.
