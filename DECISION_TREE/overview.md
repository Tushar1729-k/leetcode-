# intro
## prereqs binary search tree n machine learning basics

this card is intended to illustrate a classic algorithm for the classification problems in the domain of machine learning

by completing this card u will b able to
1. understand the intuition behind decision tree
2. implement the algo of `decision tree`
3. understand the important metrics (`gini impurity`, `entropy`) that contructing a decisiion tree involves
4. know how to evaluate the performance of decision tree model and the importance of input features

## definition
- defintion - decision tree
- model inference - decision tree
- algo - decision tree

## implementation
- splitting criterion
- gini impurity
- entropy
- entropy vs gini impurity
- calculate entropy
- calculate max info gain

## evaluation
- precision vs recall
- feature importance - decision tree
