# Introduction to 2D Array
In the previous chapter we have learned about the `one-dimensional array`. However sometimes we might need a `multidimensional array` which is more suitable for more complex structures like table or matrix.
In this chapter we are going to focus on the `two-dimensional array` to explain:
- How does a multidimensional array work?
- How to use a two-dimensional array to solve problems?
