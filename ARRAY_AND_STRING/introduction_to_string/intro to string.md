# Introduction to String
As we mentioned in the overview a `string` is an array of `characters`.
In this chapter we will go deeper into the string. After this chapter you will:
- Be familiar with the `basic operations` in a string especially the unique operations which we don't have in an array
- Understand the differences between different `comparison` functions;
- Determine whether the string is `immutable` or not in your favorite language and understand the impact of this feature;
- Be able to solve basic string-related problems.
