# Introduction
Prerequisites: Stack, Recursion I

We have discussed the basic concepts and techniques about recursion in the previous explore card called Recursion I

In this card we will dive deeper into the theme of recursion. In particular we will cover some paradigms that are often applied together with recursion to solve some problems

Here are list of topics that we cover in this card
1. `divide and conquer`
2. `backtracking`
3. `master theorem`
