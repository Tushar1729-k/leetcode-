# Introduction
We may access a `random` element by index in Array. However we might want to `restrict the processing order` in some cases

In this card we introduce two different processing orders `first-in-first-out` and `last-in-last-out` and its two corresponding linear data structures `Queue` and `Stack`

We go through the definition implementation and built-in functions for each data structure. Then we focus more on the praactical applications of these two data structures

By completing this card you should be able to 
1. understand the principle of processing orders of FIFO and LIFO
2. implement these two data structures
3. be familiar with the built-in queue and stack structure
4. solve basic queue-related problems especially `BFS`
5. solve basic stack-related problems
6. understand how system stack helps you when you solve problems using `DFS` and other `recursion` algorithms
