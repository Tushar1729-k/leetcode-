# Introduction
`Trie` aka `prefix tree` is a special form of a `Nary tree`

In this card we will go deep into the implementatioin of Trie and talk about how to use this data structure to solve problems

After completing this card you should be able to 
1. understand the `concept` of Trie
2. do `insertion` and `search` operations in a Trie
3. understand how Trie helps in `practical applications`
4. solve practical problems using Trie

## intro to trie
- what is trie?
- how to represent a trie?

## basic operations
- insertion in trie
- search in trie
- implement trie (prefix tree)
- implement trie - solution

## practical application i
- map sum pairs
- replace words
- design search autocomplete system
- add and search word - data structure design

## practical application ii
- maximum XOR of two numbers in an array
- word search ii
- word squares
- palindrome pairs
