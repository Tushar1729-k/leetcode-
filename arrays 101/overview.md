# Introduction
Arrays are a simple data structure for storing lots of similar items. They exist in all programming languages, and are used as the basis for most other data structures. On their own, Arrays can be used to solve many interesting problems. Arrays come up very often in interview problems, and so being a guru with them is a must!

In this Explore Card, we'll introduce Arrays and solve some cool problems with them. This Card is beginner friendly, and we've provided lots of code snippets in Java to help you understand. Each topic begins with informative articles, followed by real interview problems for you to practice on.

In addition, the problems have hints which will help you in building up ideas on how to solve them. These hints will be subtle enough to set you on a particular path for reaching the optimized solution, without giving away the answer too easily.

After completing this Explore Card on Arrays, you will understand:

- What an Array is.
- Basic properties of Arrays.
- Implementing basic Array operations.
- Simple programming techniques with Arrays.

Before you start, bear in mind that should you have any questions or comments, you can always post them in the Discussion forum that is located at the end of the card. We'll do our best to respond to you as soon as we can.
