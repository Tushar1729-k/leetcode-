# Introduction
A `Binary Search Tree` is a special form of binary tree. The value in each node must be `grerater than` (or equal to) any values in its `left subtree` but `less than` (or equal to) any values in its `right subtree`

We'll go through this definition more specifically in this chapter and provide you some exercises related to the binary search tree

The goal of this card is to
1. understand the `properties` of a binary tree
2. be able to do `basic operations` in a binary search tree
3. understand the concept of a `height-balanced binary search tree`
